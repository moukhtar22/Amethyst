This is an installation script to install and configure hyprland on arch linux.
This script should be used with a minimal arch linux install and with only hyprland installed since it changes some very low system stuff.
Run this script from your home directory and don't use sudo.

This is the dotfiles repo
https://github.com/voltyea/dotfiles

And here are my wallpapers
https://github.com/voltyea/my_wallpapers

You can install my dotfiles manually by running
```
git clone https://github.com/voltyea/Paradox.git
cd Paradox
sudo chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### ðŸ“¦ Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the installation script on a fresh minimal installation of arch linux.
>Clone this repo in your home folder and run the installer script.

>[!CAUTION]
> If you are thinking of installing this setup alongside some other DE, please don't â€” it will probably break something.
>DO NOT use sudo to run the installation script.


### Arch Linux


```bash
git clone https://github.com/voltyea/Amethyst.git
cd Amethyst
sudo chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
